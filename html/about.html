    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Modem is a student driven organisation that hosts radio, makes podcasts, and covers live events in and around the IT-University of Copenhagen.</p>

    <p>Modem was formed in 2012 by 11 students across different programmes. Their vision was to deliver entertaining and informative radio for the students at ITU, a vision we have upheld and expanded upon since then. Likewise, our studio has expanded from a tiny room on the second floor to anywhere in the building as we have gone mobile. This increased mobility allows us to get closer to our listeners right at the heart of ITU.</p>

    <p>Modem is run by an operational board consisting of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Asgar Bugge Hansen, President – (<a href="mailto:jlym@itu.dk">jlym@itu.dk</a>)</li>
      <li>Daniel Møgelhøj Nielsen, Vice-president (<a href="mailto:mobj@itu.dk">mobj@itu.dk</a>)</li>
      <li>Sebastian L. Karstensen, Editor-in-chief (<a href="mailto:slae@itu.dk">slae@itu.dk</a>)</li>
      <li>Zander Havgaard, Chief technician (<a href="mailto:pezh@itu.dk">pezh@itu.dk</a>)</li>
      <li>Fay-Mary B. Huish, PR (<a href="mailto:fayh@itu.dk">fayh@itu.dk</a>)</li>
      <li>Niels A. Østman, Music-editor (<a href="mailto:nies@itu.dk">nies@itu.dk</a>)</li>
    </ul>
